# CP386_A4
You must maintain the README.md file for the repository to explain the following: 
 
- Project title: Assignment 4
- Makefile 
	There is no MakeFile for this project, simply download the files and
	with GCC run
	`gcc -o Question1 190346060_190170320_a04_q1.c`
	or
	`gcc -o Question2 190346060_190170320_a04_q2.c`
	then
	`./Question1 file parameters`
	or
	`./Question2 file parameters`
- Individual contribution (Function-wise)
     Damian Young does Question 1, while Johnson Huynh does Question 2
- Features 
    The first question solves the common bankers algorithm, while the second uses a Best-Fit algorithm for contiguous memory allocation.
- Tests cases (if any) 
- Use examples 
    The most common use case would be for asset allocation at a bank for the first question, and the other question answers other common software problems in multitudes of different applications
